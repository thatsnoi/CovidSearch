        Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) are
        viruses of the family Paramyxoviridae, subfamily pneumovirus, which
        cause clinically important respiratory infections in humans and rodents,
        respectively. The respiratory epithelial target cells respond to viral
        infection with specific alterations in gene expression, including
        production of chemoattractant cytokines, adhesion molecules, elements
        that are related to the apoptosis response, and others that remain
        incompletely understood. Here we review our current understanding of
        these mucosal responses and discuss several genomic approaches,
        including differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain
        reaction (PCR) and gene array strategies, that will permit us to unravel
        the nature of these responses in a more complete and systematic manner.
