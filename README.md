# Information Retrieval for Covid-19 Research Papers using Sentence-BERT

## Abstract

Nowadays, the amount of digital information in different formats of data is in-
creasing exponentially, this ever-increasing information volume has led to the needs
and approaches to search information in an efficient and quick way. In this project,
a domain-specific COVID-19 research papers information retrieval system is pre-
sented. This search engine system consists of a fine-tuned deep learning model that
was trained with synthetically generated queries and that beats a lot of the previous
top-performing models in the TREC-COVID benchmark. Finally, an interactive web
application is presented in order to be consumed by anyone who might be interested
in.
